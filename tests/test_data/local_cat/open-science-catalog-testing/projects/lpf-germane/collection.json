  "description": "Within this project we intend to analyse ground deformation hazards induced by meteorological changes and seismotectonic conditions in eastern Belgium, western Germany and the south-eastern Netherlands. Thus, its outcomes should also be of interest for the ongoing Interreg project Einstein Telescope EMR Site & Technology (E-TEST). Focus is on the differentiation of weather-induced and seismotectonically influenced Earth surface processes in the E-Test area where human-induced groundwater level changes are also observed. The regional aspect of ground deformation in the E-Test area would be approached by Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) processing. Detailed analyses will be performed along the numerous faults crossing the E-Test area. Differential ground deformation across fault structures should, however, be quite small, probably of the amount of a few millimetres. Such small displacements require extremely precise surveying, using InSAR studies supported by the installation of fixed corner reflectors. Also, repeated very high resolution (VHR) image and digital elevation model (DEM) will be collected using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles covering the whole potentially subsiding area is necessary (supported by ground-based measurements). In parallel, geodetic monitoring using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements on benchmarks as well as Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) monitoring to determine the meteorological conditions when increase of ground deformation observed. The project also aims to develop a permanent monitoring system which would last after the duration of the project. Finally, we will develop models allowing us to manage and visualise (also in Extended Reality environments) the slow ground movements measured by remote sensing.",
