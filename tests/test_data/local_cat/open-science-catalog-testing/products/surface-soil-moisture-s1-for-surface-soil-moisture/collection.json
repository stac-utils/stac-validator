  "description": "The dataset consists of a time series of the Sentinel-1 (S-1) surface soil moisture (SSM) product at 1 km spatial resolution validated in Balenzano et al. (2021 a) over the Southern Italy. The specifications of the S-1 SSM product are provided in Balenzano et al. (2021 b). The SSM time series was obtained in correspondence of the ascending (RON A146) S-1 Interferometric Wide swath (IW) acquisition dates from January 2015 to December 2018 with a temporal gap between consecutive of 6 days (when both S-1A and S-1B data are available) or 12 days. On each date (183 in total), two co-registered layers are provided: mean SSM [m3/m3] and its standard deviation [m3/m3], which provides the SSM uncertainty. The retrieval algorithm is a time series short term change detection (STCD) that is implemented in the Ã¢â¬ÅSoil MOisture retrieval from multi-temporal SAR data (SMOSAR) code (Balenzano et al. 2013).
