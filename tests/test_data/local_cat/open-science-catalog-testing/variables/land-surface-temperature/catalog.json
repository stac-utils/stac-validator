  "description": "Refers to how hot the \"surface\" of the Earth would feel to the touch in a particular location. From a satellite's point of view, the \"surface\" is whatever it sees when it looks through the atmosphere to the ground. It could be snow and ice, the grass on a lawn, the roof of a building, or the leaves in the canopy of a forest. Thus, land surface temperature is not the same as the air temperature that is included in the daily weather report.[NASA Earth Observatory]",
