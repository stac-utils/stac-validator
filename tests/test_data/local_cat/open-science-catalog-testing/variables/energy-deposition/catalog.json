  "description": "The energy deposited into the atmosphere from ionization of atmospheric gases, as well as excitation of photometric and x-ray emissions. The ionospheric effects resulting from the energy deposition by incident particle fluxes include: - production of secondary electrons (ionization) - enhanced steady-state electron density - photometric emissions - bremsstrahlung x-rays - conductivity changes - E-region horizontal currents - plasma heating(collisional, Joule heating) - magnetic field perturbations",
