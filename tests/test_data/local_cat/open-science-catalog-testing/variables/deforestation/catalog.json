  "description": "Deforestation is the removal of trees from a locality. This removal may be either temporary or permanent, leading to partial or complete eradication of the tree cover. It can be a gradual or rapid process, and may occur by means of natural or human agencies, or a combination of both.[Goudie, Andrew. 1997. The Encyclopedic Dictionary of Physical Geography.
