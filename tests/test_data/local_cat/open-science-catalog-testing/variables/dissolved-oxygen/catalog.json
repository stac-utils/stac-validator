Gaseous oxygen has a chemical forumla of O2. Despite its abundance in air, the concentration of oxygen in water is usually quite low, at just a few parts per million. Nevertheless, this concentration is a good indicator of water quality. If it is too low, many organisms, including fish, will die.",
