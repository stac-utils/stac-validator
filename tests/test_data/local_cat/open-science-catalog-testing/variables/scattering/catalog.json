  "description": "The process in which a wave or beam of particles is diffused or deflected by collisions with particles of the medium which it traverses. Along with absorption, scattering is a major cause of the attenuation of radiation by the atmosphere. The process by which some of a stream of radiation is dispersed to travel in directions other than that which from it was incident by particles suspended in the medium through which it is travelling.",
