  "description": "Extreme precipitation events in the form of high amounts of rainfall can contribute to flooding, landslides and mud flows. Effects of extreme precipitation on the natural environment can often be disproportionally larger than the cumulative effect of normal precipitation patterns. The magnitude of societal impacts of extremes depends upon a variety of factors such geographic location, population density, infrastructure design standards and emergency response systems (Parry et al., 2007)",
