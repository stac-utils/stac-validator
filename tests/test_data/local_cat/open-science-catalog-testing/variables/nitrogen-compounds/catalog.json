  "description": "Nitrogen (N) is the most abundant constituent of the atmosphere (78.09%). Nitrogen enters the atmosphere from volcanoes, and from the decay of organic matter. It is removed from the atmosphere by nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Nitrogen compounds are very reactive and play integral roles in the production and destruction of ozone in the atmosphere.[American Meteorological Society. 2000. Glossary of Meteorology, Second Edition. Boston, MA: American Meteorological Society.]Nitrogen compounds refer to the nitrogen particles that come from industrial manufacturing which cause contamination to water resources.[Princeton University]",
