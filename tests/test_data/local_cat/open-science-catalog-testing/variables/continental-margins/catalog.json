  "description": "The ocean floor from the shore of a continent to the abyssal plain. The continent margin is the zone separating the continents from the deep-sea bottom, usually subdivided into the continental shelf, slope, and rise. They are two basic types of continental margins: passive, or Atlantic, margins and active, or Pacific, margins. Passive margins have little seismic or volcanic activity and form when continents are rifted apart, creating a new ocean basin between them. Active margins are tectonically active and are most often associated with plate convergence and subduction.",
