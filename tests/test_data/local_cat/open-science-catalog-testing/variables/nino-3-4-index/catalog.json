  "description": "The NINO3.4 index is one of several El Niï¿½o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) indicators based on sea surface temperatures. NINO3.4 is the average sea surface temperature anomaly in the region bounded by 5ï¿½N to 5ï¿½S, from 170ï¿½W to 120ï¿½W. This region has large variability on El Niï¿½o time scales, and is close to the region where changes in local sea-surface temperature are important for shifting the large region of rainfall typically located in the far western Pacific. An El Niï¿½o or La Niï¿½a event is identified if the 5-month running-average of the NINO3.4 index exceeds +0.4ï¿½C for El Niï¿½o or -0.4ï¿½C for La Niï¿½a for at least 6 consecutive months.",
