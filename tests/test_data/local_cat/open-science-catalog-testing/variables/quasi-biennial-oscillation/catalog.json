  "description": "The quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) is a quasi-periodic oscillation of the equatorial zonal wind between easterlies and westerlies in the tropical stratosphere with a mean period of 28 to 29 months. A stratospheric (16 to 35 km altitude) oscillation of equatorial east-west winds which vary with a period of about 26 to 30 months or roughly 2 years; typically blowing for 12-16 months from the east, then reverse and blowing 12-16 months from the west, then back to easterly again.",
