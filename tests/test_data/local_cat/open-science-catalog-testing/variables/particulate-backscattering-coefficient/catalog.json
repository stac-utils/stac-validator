  "description": "Particulate matter (particulate backscatter coefficient at 443nm, bbp in m^-1 at 4km resolution): The backscatter coefficient bbp represents the fraction of incident light that is scattered backward from its original path by particulate material in the water. The backscattering coefficient gives a good indication of the concentration of suspended organic and inorganic particles (e.g. sediments) in the water.",
