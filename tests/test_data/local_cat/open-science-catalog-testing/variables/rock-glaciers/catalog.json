There are two types of rock glaciers: periglacial glaciers, or talus-derived glaciers, and glacial rock glaciers. It is defined also as a mass of rock fragments and finer material, on a slope, that contains either interstitial ice or an ice core and shows evidence of past or present movement (NSIDC)",
