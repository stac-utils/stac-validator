Restoration is the return of an ecosystem to a close approximation of its condition prior to disturbance. Revegetation is the planting of vegetation in an area where vegetation has been removed.[National Research Council. 1992. Restoration of Aquatic Ecosystems: science, technology, and public policy. National Academy Press. Washington, D.C., 1992.]Restoration: The processes by which an area is treated in an attempt to restore original conditions. Reclamation: The process of reconverting land to other forms of productive uses. Revegetation: Reestablishment of vegetation which may take place naturally or be induced by humans through seeding or transplanting.[The Nature and Properties of Soils, Prentice Hall, 1996.
