  "description": "Our climate index is a simple measure of the degree, if any, to which practical climate change is occurring. It also illustrates natural climate variability, thus revealing how difficult it is to reliably perceive a change of quantities that are naturally \"noisy\" or chaotic. Our aim is to help people judge whether or not climate fluctuations are a significant indication of change and to provide improved understanding of climate variability.
