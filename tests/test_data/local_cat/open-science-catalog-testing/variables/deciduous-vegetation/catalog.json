  "description": "Deciduous vegetation is vegetation that sheds its leaves each year in the fall. Maple, oak, black cherry, and beech trees are examples. The loss of leaves in the fall is believed to be an adaptation that greatly reduces evaporation at a time when the supply of liquid water is limited.[Chiras, Daniel D. 1998. Environmental Science. A Systems Approach to Sustainable Development. Wadsworth Publishing Company. Belmont, California.]",
