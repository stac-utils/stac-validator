  "description": "Coronal mass ejection (CME) is a huge cloud of hot plasma, occasionally expelled from the Sun. It may accelerate ions and electrons and may travel through interplanetary space as far as the Earthï¿½s orbit and beyond it, often preceded by a shock front. When the shock reaches Earth, a magnetic storm may result.",
