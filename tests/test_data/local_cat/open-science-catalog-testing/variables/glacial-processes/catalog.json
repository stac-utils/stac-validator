  "description": "A glacier is an accumulation of ice, air, water, and rock debris or sediment. It is a large enough quantity of ice to flow with gravity due to its own mass. The ice can be as large as a continent, such as the ice sheet covering Antarctica; or, it can fill a small valley between two mountains, such as a valley glacier. \"Glacial landforms/processes\" refers to the erosional or depositional processes of glaciers and the landforms (e.g., drumlins, cirques, fjords) that result.",
