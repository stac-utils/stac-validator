  "description": "Solar X-Ray emissions can consist of X-Ray background flux or X-Ray bursts. A daily average background X-ray flux is in the 1 to 8 angstrom range. It is a midday minimum designed to reduce the effects of flares. X-Ray burstsare a temporary enhancement of the X-ray emission of the sun. The time-intensity profile of soft X-ray bursts is similar to that of the H-Alpha profile of an associated flare. Bursts last from minutes to several hours.",
