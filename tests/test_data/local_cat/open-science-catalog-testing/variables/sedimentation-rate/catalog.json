  "description": "For conditions in the lowest 10-15 km of Earth's atmosphere, the sedimentation (or fall) rate of a spherical cloud particle is given as the characteristic time for it to fall a distance of one atmospheric scale height (about 8 km on Earth) by tau-1fall = (2 rhop mg2 / 9 eta kT ) r2M where eta is the atmospheric dynamic viscosity (the resistance of the atmosphere to movement through it), (kT/mg) is the atmospheric scale height (k is Boltzmann's constant, T is atmospheric temperature, m is weight of a gas molecule, g is acceleration by gravity), rhop is the mass density of the cloud particle, and rM is the mass-weighted-average cloud particle radius. Essentially, the sedimentation rate increases proportionally to the particle cross-section (r2M).",
