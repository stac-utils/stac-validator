  "description": "An atom (or molecule) which has become charged as a result of gaining or losing one or more orbiting electrons. A completely ionized atom is one stripped of all its electrons. Heavy ions are those ionized particles at high energy (MeV range). Flux is the rate of flow through a reference surface, measured in particles per unit area.",
