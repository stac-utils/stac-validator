  "description": "Jointly funded by NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration, USA), INPE (National Institute for Space Research, Brazil) and JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency), Aqua (formerly known as EOS/PM-1) is part of NASAs international Earth Observing System (EOS), as well as their Earth Science Enterprise (ESE) program. Aquas main focus is the multidisciplinary study of the Earths water cycle including cloud formation, precipitation, radiative properties, air-sea fluxes of energy, carbon and moisture, and sea ice concentrations and extents. Launched in May 2002 from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, USA, Aqua had a design life of six years, however remains operational as of July 2022. The HSB instrument failed on the 5th of February 2003.",
