  "description": "Launched in October 2005, CryoSat was a next-generation radar altimetry mission, aiming to determine variations in the thickness of the Earths continental ice sheets and marine ice cover. Primary objective is to test the prediction of thinning arctic ice due to global warming. CryoSat was supposed to be the first Earth Explorer Opportunity mission in ESAs Living Planet program, but was lost in a launch failure on 8 October 2005, prompting the development of a successor mission, CryoSat-2.",
