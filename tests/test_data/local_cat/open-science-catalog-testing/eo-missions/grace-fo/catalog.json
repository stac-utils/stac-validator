  "description": "Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment - Follow On (GRACE-FO) is the successor to the original Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission. The two identical satellites, a joint mission of NASA and the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) were launched from California, USA, in May 2018. GRACE-FO maintains data continuity for measuring changes in high-resolution monthly global models of EarthÂ’s gravitational field, achieved by tracking water movement and surface mass changes across the planet. GRACE-FO applications include monitoring water storage, ice sheets and glaciers, sea level, and solid earth, similar to that of its predecessor, GRACE.",
