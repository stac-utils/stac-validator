  "description": "Launched in November 2013, Swarm is a constellation of three satellites operated by the European Space Agency (ESA) with the purpose of mapping EarthÂ’s magnetic field. All three Swarm satellites carry the same instruments: a Vector Field Magnetometer (VFM) that measures the direction of the magnetic field; an Absolute Scalar Magnetometer (ASM) that measures the strength of the magnetic field; an Electric Field Instrument (EFI) that measures the plasma density, drift, and acceleration; as well as a Micro Accelerometer-04 (MAC-04) that measures the air drag, winds, Earth albedo, and solar radiation pressure.",
