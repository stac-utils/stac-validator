It will develop climate and weather forecasting models by understanding the role of cloud-aerosol-radiation interactions. To Improve the understanding of atmospheric cloudÂ–aerosol interactions and of the Earth's radiative balance towards enhancing climate and numerical weather prediction models. The 2 active and 2 passive instruments of EarthCARE make unique data product synergies possible.",
