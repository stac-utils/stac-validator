Its observations are used to determine the role of clouds and aerosols in regulating the Earths climate. 3-year nominal mission life, currently in extended operations. Measurements of aerosol and cloud properties for climate predictions, using a 3 channel lidar and passive instruments in formation with CloudSat for coincident observations of radiative fluxes and atmospheric state.",
